# Next.js Link Component Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the Next.js Link component and how to resolve it. The problem is that links are not rendering the correct pages, instead showing blank pages or incorrect content.

## Problem

The original code uses the Next.js Link component to navigate between pages. However, the links do not work as intended. 

## Solution

The solution involves verifying the `pages` directory structure, confirming the `href` values in the Link component match the file names in the `pages` directory, and checking for any typos in the code or route definitions. If the issue persists, verify that the page components being linked to are correctly exported and that they are actually returning valid JSX. 

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Click on the links and observe the behavior.  

## Additional Notes

This is a basic example and the exact reason for the failure may vary in real-world scenarios. Always ensure to double-check your Next.js configuration, file structure and component implementation.
